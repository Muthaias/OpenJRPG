OpenJRPG
========
OpenJRPG aims to be a basic implementation of a Role Playing Game of the Japanese model. The Japanese RPG has some special characteristics which will make it stand out from usual european RPGs. The character design, the battle system, the world interaction structure and the item collection are all integral parts which needs care in order to make a great JRPG.

Development direction
========
Most of the development will initially be done in C++ but a later switch to C# might be of interest just for shits and giggle. Yes really.
